Agriculture is important in the preservation of humanity because it is the main source of food supply on which all countries depend whether it is growing or advanced.
Agriculture is important in the preservation of humanity because it is the main

source of food supply on which all countries depend whether it is growing or

advanced. It is also an important factor in the development of any country. It is

the primary source of raw materials in many industries. Agriculture is also

critical for economic growth: In 2018, it accounted for 4% of global GDP, and in

some LDCs, it could account for more than 25% of GDP, as approved by the

World Bank.

Machine vision and artificial neural networks have brought significant

advancements in the field of disease identification and diagnosis. Among the

various neural network architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

have emerged as a powerful tool for image classification tasks. CNNs are

particularly effective for detecting patterns and features in images that are

relevant for disease identification. One of the latest CNN architectures that

have gained popularity in recent years is EfficientNet, which has shown

superior performance in image classification tasks compared to other CNN

models.

In this project, we will be utilizing CNNs and EfficientNet to identify diseases in

plants and other organisms through machine vision. These models will be

trained using transfer learning techniques, which enable us to reuse

pre-trained models and adapt them to our specific problem domain. By
fine-tuning these models on our dataset, we can create a powerful disease

identification system that can accurately detect diseases in plants.

The integration of machine vision, deep learning, and ANNs has led to a

significant improvement in disease identification and diagnosis. The project will

showcase the effectiveness of these technologies in the field of agriculture,

which can have a significant impact on crop yield and food security.
